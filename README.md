# Nirvana project

## Project description

Project instructions
Suppose you have 3 different APIs you can call with member_id as a parameter.

 

so example API calls would be:

 

https://api1.com?member_id=1

https://api2.com?member_id=1

https://api3.com?member_id=1

 

and you'll get responses from these apis with similar responses:

 

API1: {deductible: 1000, stop_loss: 10000, oop_max: 5000}

API2: {deductible: 1200, stop_loss: 13000, oop_max: 6000}

API3: {deductible: 1000, stop_loss: 10000, oop_max: 6000}

 

As you can see above the API's don't always agree. The task is to build an API that calls these APIs and coalesces the responses with a strategy. 



An example strategy could be the average of the response fields. With the average strategy, your coalesce API would respond with:

{deductible: 1066, stop_loss: 11000, oop_max: 5666}

 

Your API should:

Take in the member_id as a parameter
Make the calls to the different APIs
Coalesce the data returned by the APIs
As a bonus challenge: allow for the coalescing strategy to be configurable
 

What we are looking for:

Testing,

Design Patterns,

Efficiency,

and last but not least creativity!

 

Note: We recommend using a lightweight framework like Flask or FastAPI for this project (we use FastAPI at Nirvana), but feel free to use whatever framework you are most familiar with!
